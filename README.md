## Introduction

The Python Calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a simple text-based interface and supports continuous calculations with previous results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujaljoshi7/Python-Calculator.git
    cd python-calculator
    ```

2. **Ensure you have Python installed:**

    This script requires Python 3. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Ensure you have the `art` file in the same directory:**

    Make sure the `art.py` file containing the logo is in the same directory as the main script.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**

    To start the program, simply run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

2. **Input the Required Information:**

    - The program will display a welcome logo and prompt users to enter the first number.
    - It will then display the available operations and prompt users to pick one.
    - Users will be asked to enter the second number.
    - The program will display the result of the operation.
    - Users can choose to continue the calculation with the previous result or start a new calculation.

3. **Example:**

    ```bash
    Welcome to the Python Calculator!
    What's the first number? 10
    +
    -
    *
    /
    Pick an operation: +
    What's the second number? 5
    10 + 5 = 15
    Do you want to continue calculation with previous answer? Type 'y' to continue and 'n' to exit: y
    Pick an operation: *
    What's the second number? 2
    15 * 2 = 30
    Do you want to continue calculation with previous answer? Type 'y' to continue and 'n' to exit: n
    ```

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Allows continuous calculations using the result of the previous operation.
- Simple and easy-to-use text-based interface.
